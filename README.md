This README is a summary of all the useful information taught in *Meta Data Analytics Specialization* offered by (you guessed it!) Meta. We begin by introducing the **OSEMN framework** (read it as "awesome") which is consisted of the following steps:

- **Obtain**: Gather data from relevant, reliable sources (company's DB, online, ..)
- **Scrub**: Clean the data to insure a consistent and useful format (e.g. size in 40 and Medium, remove duplicates, ..)
- **Explore**: Search for patterns (plotting the distributions)
- **Model**: Generate predictions and insights (run models)
- **iNterpret**: present and communicate your insights (plots, tables, ..), this is the final step which is handed as output in presentations (slide presentation)



### Step 1: start with a SMART goal:

Measurable
Achievable

### Step 3: OSEMN framework:

- ### Obtain: 
  Where do data analysts obtain data & what sources are available to you?
  
  Data can be harnessed to answer questions and solve problems. Making it an invaluable resource for businesses and individuals. We try to obtain the **right** data for our analytics objectives and business goals.

  ### Where to look for data? (categories of data sources)

    #### 1. Freely accessible, open source databases. (e.g. government websites and open source repositories)
    #### 2. Data specific to your company. (not freely accessible)
  
  - data collected by the company (website visits records through Google Analytics)  
  - data the company subscribes to
    
  A few examples of databases companies can buy or subscribe to:
