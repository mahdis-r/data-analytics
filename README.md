# data-analytics
This README is a summary of all the useful information taught in *Meta Data Analytics Specialization* offered by (you guessed it!) Meta. We begin by introducing the **OSEMN framework** (read it as "awesome") which is consisted of the following steps:

- **Obtain**: Gather data from relevant, reliable sources (company's DB, online, ..)
- **Scrub**: Clean the data to insure a consistent and useful format (e.g. size in 40 and Medium, remove duplicates, ..)
- **Explore**: Search for patterns (plotting the distributions)
- **Model**: Generate predictions and insights (run models)
- **iNterpret**: present and communicate your insights (plots, tables, ..), this is the final step which is handed as output in presentations (slide presentation)



### Step 1: start with a SMART goal:
Specific 
Measurable
Achievable
Relevant
Time-bounded

### Step 2: Indicate KPIs: Key Performance Indicators (to evaluate your progress achieveing your goal)
Measurable value that can help you track your progress toward your goal.
They aree:
- Measurable (quantitative)
- Directional (goes up or down)
- Directly related to your goal (**Primary KPIs** - **Secondry KPIs** correlates to your primary kpis)


### Step 3: OSEMN framework:

- ### Obtain: 
  Where do data analysts obtain data & what sources are available to you?
  
  Data can be harnessed to answer questions and solve problems. Making it an invaluable resource for businesses and individuals. We try to obtain the **right** data for our analytics objectives and business goals.

  ### Where to look for data? (categories of data sources)

    ### 1. Freely accessible, open source databases. (e.g. government websites and open source repositories)


    **Google Public Dataset Search**
    Like Google Scholar, Google Dataset Search provides access to millions of datasets hosted on public websites, such as Kaggle and OGD Platform India, in thousands of locations on the internet.

    **United States Census Bureau**
    The United States Census Bureau provides access to quality and essential data about the United States’ population, economy, and geography.

    Link: 
    www.census.gov

    **Pew Research Center**
    The Pew Research Center provides insights and analysis on a wide range of social, political, and technological issues through surveys and research.

    **Eurostat**
    As the European Union's statistical office, Eurostat provides comprehensive economic, social, and environmental data.

    Link: 
    www.ec.europa.eu/eurostat

    **The Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD)**
    The OECD is a reliable source for comparative data and analysis on global economic and social matters.

    **Kaggle Datasets**
    Kaggle hosts hundreds of thousands of high-quality public datasets from several industries to explore, analyze, and share.

    **National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI)**
    NCEI is part of NOAA’s Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research and provides environmental data regarding climate change and global chemical measurements.

    www.ncei.noaa.gov

    **World Bank Open Data**
    This comprehensive dataset includes indicators such as population size and unemployment rates collected from hundreds of countries worldwide, offering insights into global economic, social, and environmental trends.

    ### 2. Data specific to your company. (not freely accessible)
  
  - data collected by the company (website visits records through Google Analytics)  
  - data the company subscribes to
    
  A few examples of databases companies can buy or subscribe to:

  - **Nielsen data:** data about people's media usage habits, like `how much TV they watch`, `which channels they tune into`, `which programs they watch` for `how long`
    They track the behavior of people who are agreed to be tracked. And then they provide that data to subscribers.

    TV channels or websites will use that data to inform their advertisers. e.g. In their sales pitches to sneaker brands they might refer to how many people are watcging their programs, enticing the sneaker brands to advertise with them.

  - **Bloomberg:** financial information.

   ### 3. Data you intentionally collect.
  - create questionnaires/surveys
    some tools: SurveyMonkey, Google Forms
  - organize interviews with customers
  - observe people while they're using your product and record what you see (with their premission!)
